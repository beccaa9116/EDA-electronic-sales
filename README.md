# 📊Electronic Sales Insights✨

## Overview 💫

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of electronic sales. The goal is to understand the key factors influencing sales performance and explore various trends within the data. The analysis uses descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify potential business insights.

## Key Insights 📈

- **Product Category Analysis**: Certain product categories show significantly higher sales, indicating which product types are more popular among customers.
- **Sales by Age Group**: Data reveal age groups with varying demand
- **Price and Sales**: Higher-priced products generally have lower sales volumes, while mid-priced products perform better, suggesting price sensitivity in consumer behavior.

## Data Cleaning and Processing 🗂️

The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and outliers. Unnecessary columns were removed, and data transformation was applied to ensure it was in the right format for analysis.

## Visualizations 🧮

- **Bar Charts**: Used for comparing sales across product categories and regions.
- **Scatter Plots**: To examine relationships between price and sales volume.
- **Box Plots**: To identify outliers and understand sales distribution within various categories.
